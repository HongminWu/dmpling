# DMPling

*dmpling* implements the Dynamic Movement Primitives framework
in Python. The papers it was based on can be found in the 
literature directory, but the main paper is  
[Dynamical Movement Primitives: Learning Attractor 
Models for Motor Behaviors](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/courses/amath579/reading/DynamicPrimitives.pdf)
of Ijspeert et al.  


## Examples
Scripts in the examples directory demonstrate how DMPs can
imitate a trajectory and perform temporal and spatial scaling 
and translation.


## Dependencies
* numpy

## Installation
~$ pip install dmpling
